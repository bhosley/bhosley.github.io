Like many new programmers my first experience with coding was a simple Arduino project. I was proud of it at the time, but now I can look back on it as a cute project, not unlike my first watercolor. Luckily this particular one wouldn't end up embarrassingly displayed at my father's home. Unluckily, it WOULD end up embarrassingly displayed in front of several thousand people, as the brain of a Halloween prop at the front of a fairly popular Colorado Haunted house.

This prop was not the first one that I had built, in fact, for quite some time I had been building props, painting, doing special effects, etc. This was the first prop I had built that needed a microcomputer to control all of its functions. While the prop itself ended up well received I wouldn't touch code again for several months. The next time would be at the end of a degree program studying IT.

The programming course that I would take would be one that was required for the program, and it would be in the challenging and impressive language of Visual Basic. 

As it should happen I took well to this class. Better than I had any of my other courses honestly. VB was easy enough, but left a lot to be desired. I ended up doing each project in VB, for the class, and C#, for me. After the class I would end up doing a fair bit of self study. 

At the time of this writing I am studying with FlatIron and preparing several prerequisites for advanced study in Computer Science. 

There seems to be a long road ahead of me, but so far I have loved every step.
